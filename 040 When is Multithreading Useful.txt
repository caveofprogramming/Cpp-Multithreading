/*
 * When is multithreading useful?
 * 
 * 1. When you're waiting for something external and want to execute code meanwhile.
 * (asynchronous execution)
 * 
 * Example: pinging remote servers
 * Example: drawing graphics while also processing user input
 * 
 * 2. Distributing processing across multiple cores
 * 
 * Example: calculating pi to lots of digits
